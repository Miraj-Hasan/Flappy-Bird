Here a bird will fly and many pillars
will appear across it's path.To survive,
the bird has to fly through the gaps
between the pillars and for crossing each
pillar one point will be added.By  using
the 'UP' arrow of keyboard or by clicking
the 'left button' of mouse a player can
control the flight of the bird.And there
will be three lives.
